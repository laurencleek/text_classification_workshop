# 🧠 Text Classification with LLMs: A Hands-on Workshop

This repository contains all materials for the workshop **"Text Classification with LLMs: A Hands-on Workshop"**, designed for social science researchers interested in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance text classification tasks.

---

## 📘 Overview

This interactive workshop combines **theoretical foundations** with **practical applications** of Large Language Models (LLMs) for text classification.  
Participants learn how to:
- Pre-process and prepare text data for LLMs.
- Build a classification pipeline in **Python / Google Colab**.
- Validate and interpret model results.
- Troubleshoot common issues in text classification projects.
- Reflect on **ethical and methodological considerations** when using LLMs in research.

The session also provides opportunities to start working with your own datasets.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can run the notebook directly in Google Colab — no local installation required.

### 1. Open the Colab Notebook
Click the badge below to open the notebook:

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](YOUR_COLAB_LINK_HERE)

### 2. Upload the Validation File
Before running the code:
- Upload `validation_sample.xlsx` to your Colab session.
- The notebook will use this file for model validation and demonstration.

### 3. Run the Cells
Follow the notebook cells step-by-step.  
Each section corresponds to a concept discussed in the slides:
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Prompt-based and fine-tuned classification  
3. Evaluation metrics  
4. Troubleshooting and improvement strategies

## 🧠 Learning Goals

By the end of this workshop, you will:
- Understand the logic behind LLM-based text classification.
- Know how to build and evaluate your own classification pipeline.
- Gain familiarity with **prompt design**, **model selection**, and **ethical reflection**.
- Be able to extend the notebook to your own research data.

## ⚙️ Technical Requirements

- A Google account (for Colab access)
- Internet connection
- Optional: OpenAI API key (if using GPT-based models)
- Basic familiarity with Python is helpful, but not required

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Introduction to text classification and its social science applications  
- Comparison between traditional NLP methods and LLM-based classification  
- Data cleaning, tokenization, and preprocessing  
- Prompt engineering and few-shot learning  
- Evaluating model performance (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix)  
- Common pitfalls and debugging  
- Responsible and ethical use of LLMs

---

## 🧩 Extend to Your Own Data

The notebook includes modular code blocks that you can adapt to your own dataset.  
Replace the sample data with your text and labels, and modify the prompts accordingly.
