# 🧠 Text Classification with LLMs: A Hands-on Workshop

This repository contains all materials for the workshop **"Text Classification with LLMs: A Hands-on Workshop"**, designed for social science researchers interested in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance text classification tasks.

---

## 📘 Overview

This interactive workshop combines **theoretical foundations** with **practical applications** of Large Language Models (LLMs) for text classification.  
Participants learn how to:
- Pre-process and prepare text data for LLMs.
- Build a classification pipeline in **Python / Google Colab**.
- Validate and interpret model results.
- Troubleshoot common issues in text classification projects.
- Reflect on **ethical and methodological considerations** when using LLMs in research.

The session also provides opportunities to start working with your own datasets.
